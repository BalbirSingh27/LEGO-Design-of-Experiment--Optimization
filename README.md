# 🏎️ DOE-Based LEGO Car Optimization – Balancing Performance and Cost

---

## 🎯 Objective
Design and build a cost-effective LEGO racing car that **maximizes distance traveled**, using **Design of Experiments (DOE)** to analyze key performance factors.

---

## 🧪 Experimental Setup
- Conducted in a closed team room at McCord Hall
- Ramp made from a cardboard notepad supported by desk organizers
- Distance measured in cm using a mobile device
- Response Variable: Distance traveled by the car

---

## 🔧 Factors Analyzed
- **Wheel Size**: Small / Big  
- **Length**: Short / Long  
- **Weight**: No Weight / Weight Added  
- **Design**: Narrow / Wide

---

## 🧬 DOE Design
- **4 Factors**, **16 runs**, **1 replicate**
- Randomized run order (using Minitab)
- Controlled environment to reduce variation

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Significant factors**:  
  - ✅ Wheel Size (A)  
  - ✅ Design (D)  
- Initial model R²(pred): **60.78%**
- Refined model with interaction (A*D): **R²(pred) = 75.50%**

---

## 📈 Model Adequacy
- Residual plots confirm NID assumptions
- Normality and histogram plots validate model assumptions
- Versus Order and Fit plots indicate control and consistency

---

## 🔍 Visual Insights
- **Main Effects Plot**: Big wheels & narrow design = max distance  
- **Interaction Plot**: A & D almost parallel – minimal interaction  
- **Contour Plot**: Best performance at (Big wheels, Narrow design)

---

## 🏆 Best Configuration
**Wheel Size**: Big (+1)  
**Design**: Narrow (-1)  
**Length**: Short (-1)  
**Weight**: No extra weight (-1)

---

## 💰 Financial Analysis
- Top 4 car models evaluated
- **Model 4** (Best performer):  
  - Lowest cost  
  - Maximum distance traveled  
  - Most cost-effective design

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Using DOE, we identified and validated the **optimal LEGO car configuration** that balanced performance with cost. By focusing on key factors like wheel size and design, we achieved a competitive and efficient result.
